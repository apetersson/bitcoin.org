<h2><a name="general">General</a></h2>

<h3><a name="what-is-bitcoin">What is Bitcoin</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin is a payment system and open-source software platform that enables a new, completely digital and decentralized money called bitcoins (BTC).</p>

<h3><a name="who-created-bitcoin">Who created Bitcoin?</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin is one of the first implementations of a concept called crypto-currency, which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list. Building upon the notion that money is any object, or any sort of record, accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed around the idea of a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions, rather than relying on central authorities.</p>
<p>In 2009, the first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was published in a cryptography mailing list by a member under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. Towards the end of 2010 Satoshi left the project, saying he had moved on to other things. The creator of Bitcoin never revealed his identity and simply left his invention to the world. The origin and the motivation behind Bitcoin are still today a great source of mystery.</p>
<p>Since 2010, the Bitcoin community has grown with many developers working on the project. During June and July 2011, Bitcoin suddenly gained media attention leading to a massive buy rally. The resulting bubble slowly deflated through the latter part of 2011, and since then the value of Bitcoin has slowly climbed once again back to its 2011 heights.</p>
<p>On September 27th 2012, the Bitcoin Foundation was created in an effort to standardize, protect, and promote Bitcoin. Today, the Bitcoin economy is developing quickly with new users joining every day.</p>

<h3><a name="how-does-bitcoin-work">How does Bitcoin work?</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin is a <a href="http://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/001325.html">triple entry bookkeeping system</a> where a public ledger of every Bitcoin transaction is validated and distributed in real-time through the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network. The whole network is secured and regulated through cryptography. Anyone can process transactions using computer processing power, often with specialized hardware, and potentially earn a reward in bitcoins for this service. This is often called "bitcoin mining".</p>

<h3><a name="how-does-one-acquire-bitcoins">How does one acquire bitcoins?</a></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Accept bitcoins as payment for goods or services.</li>
	<li>Buy bitcoins at one of the <a href="http://howtobuybitcoins.info">Bitcoin Exchanges</a>.</li>
	<li>Trade traditional currency for bitcoins with <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/">someone near you</a>.</li>
	<li>Earn bitcoins through competitive <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining">mining</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is possible to find an individual who wishes to sell bitcoins to you in exchange for a credit card or PayPal payment, most exchanges do not allow funding for these payment methods. This is due to repeated cases where someone pays for bitcoins with PayPal, receives their bitcoins, and then fraudulently fill a complain that they never received their purchase, often succesfully reversing the transaction. Most exchanges cannot afford the risk and require irreversible payments, such as wire transfer.</p>

<h3><a name="how-difficult-is-it-to-make-a-bitcoin-payment">How difficult is it to make a Bitcoin payment?</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin payments are easier to make than any existing banking or credit card process.  Payments are made from a wallet application, either on your computer or smartphone, by entering the recipient's address. This can be done by scanning a QR code, touching two phones together with NFC technology, or copying and pasting, entering the amount, and pressing send.</p>

<h3><a name="what-are-the-advantages-of-bitcoin">What are the advantages of Bitcoin?</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li><em><b>Unrestrained payments</b></em> - It is possible to send and receive any amount of money anywhere in the world at any time. No bank holidays. No borders. No imposed limits.</li>
  <li><em><b>Low or zero fees</b></em> - Bitcoin payments are currently processed with either no fees or extremely small fees. Users may include fees with transactions to receive priority processing, which results in faster confirmation of transactions by the network. Additionally, merchant processors exist to assist merchants in processing transactions, converting bitcoins to fiat currencies with daily direct deposits to bank accounts, and to provide these services for much lower fees and less risk than with PayPal or credit card networks.</li>
  <li><em><b>Fewer fees and risks for merchants</b></em> - Bitcoin transactions are secure, irreversible, and do not contain customers’ sensitive or personal information. This protects merchants from losses caused by fraud or fraudulent chargebacks and there is no need for PCI compliance. Consequently, merchants can easily expand to new markets where either credit cards are not available or fraud rates are unacceptably high. The net results are lower fees, larger markets, and fewer administrative costs.</li>
  <li><em><b>More protection for consumers</b></em> - Bitcoin payments are made without needing the personal information tied to the transaction. This offers strong protection against identity theft. Users are in full control of their transactions, therefore it is impossible for merchants to force unwanted or unnoticed charges - this can happen with ACH debits, debit cards, PayPal, and credit cards.</li>
  <li><em><b>Transparency</b></em> - <a href=\"http://blockchain.info\">All information</a> concerning the Bitcoin money supply is readily available on the block chain for anybody to see, verify, measure, and use in real-time.</li>
  <li><em><b>Distributed</b></em> - The Bitcoin ledger, commonly called the block chain, is distributed throughout the world and stored by Bitcoin miners. This adds a level of resiliency and redundancy that is unmatched in the payments space and a payment processing network. For example, the Federal Reserve does all their payment processing at 100 Orchard Street, East Rutherford, New Jersey and it has back-up systems that can be brought online within 60-90 minutes at the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and Dallas. If those three centers were compromised or destroyed then the entire monetary system of the Federal Reserve would be greatly impaired and probably completely non-functional.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name=#what-are-the-disadvantages-of-bitcoin">What are the disadvantages of Bitcoin?</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li><em><b>Not widely accepted</b></em> - Many people are still unaware of Bitcoin.  Every day more businesses accept bitcoins because they want the advantages of doing so, but the list remains small and still needs to grow in order to gain improved usefulness through networking effects.</li>
  <li><em><b>Volatile</b></em> - The <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts/market-cap\">total value</a> of bitcoins in circulation and the number of businesses using Bitcoin are still very small compared to what they could be. Therefore, relatively small movements in the market can significantly affect the price. In theory, this volatility will persist as the market scrambles to determine a bitcoin’s price and as this new currency matures.  Never before has the world seen a start-up currency, so it is truly difficult (and exciting) to imagine how it will play out.</li>
  <li><em><b>For geeks</b></em> - Many of the user tools are still not ready for everyone and users still need to protect their money by themselves, or trust young online wallet services that still don’t offer any insurance against theft or other bad events. New tools and services are constantly being developed to make Bitcoin more accessible to the masses. From now, Bitcoin is a bright new invention that starts to meet the real world.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="can-i-make-money-with-bitcoin">Can I make money with Bitcoin?</a></h3>

FIXME Bitcoin cannot offer "too good to be true", scam, etc. But mining / speculating can report money

<p>
Since Bitcoin is a new technology, what it is and how it works may be initially unclear. Bitcoin is sometimes presented as being one of three things that are too good to be true:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Some sort of online 'get-rich-quick' scam.</li>
  <li>A loophole in the market economy, the installation of which guarantees a steady influx of cash.</li>
  <li>A sure investment that will almost certainly yield a profit.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In fact, none of the above are true. Let's look at them independently.
</p>

<h4>Is Bitcoin a 'get-rich-quick' scheme?</h4>

<p>If you've spent much time on the Internet, you've probably seen ads for many 'get-rich-quick' schemes. These ads usually promise huge profits for a small amounts of easy work. Such schemes are usually pyramid/matrix-style schemes that make money from their own employees and offer nothing of any real value. Most convince one to buy packages that will make them earn hundreds a day, which in fact have the buyer distribute more such ads, and make minute profits.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is in no way similar to these schemes. Bitcoin doesn't promise windfall profits. There is no way for the developers to make money from your involvement or to take money from you. That bitcoins are nearly impossible to acquire without the owner's consent represents one of its greatest strengths. Bitcoin is an experimental, virtual currency that may succeed or may fail. None of its developers expect to get rich off of it.</p> 

<p>A more detailed answer to this question can be found <a href="http://bitcointalk.org/?topic=7815.0">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Will I make money by installing the client?</h4>

<p>Most people who use Bitcoin don't earn anything by doing so, and the default client has no built-in way to earn Bitcoins. A small minority of people with dedicated, high-performance hardware do earn some Bitcoins by "<i>mining</i>" (generating new bitcoins, see [[#What is mining?|What is mining?]]) with special software, but joining Bitcoin shouldn't be construed as being the road to riches. Most Bitcoin users get involved because they find the project conceptually interesting and don't earn anything by doing so. This is also why you won't find much speculation about the political or economic repercussions of Bitcoin anywhere on this site: Bitcoin developers owe their dedication to the project's intellectual yieldings more than to those of a monetary nature. Bitcoin is still taking its first baby steps; it may go on to do great things but right now it only has something to offer those chasing conceptually interesting projects or bleeding edge technology.
</p>

<h4>As an investment, is Bitcoin a sure thing?</h4>
<p>Bitcoin is a new and interesting electronic currency, the value of which is not backed by any single government or organization. Like other currencies, it is worth something partly because people are willing to trade it for goods and services. Its exchange rate fluctuates continuously, and sometimes wildly. It lacks wide acceptance and is vulnerable to manipulation by parties with modest funding. Security incidents such as website and account compromise may trigger major sell-offs. Other fluctuations can build into positive feedback loops cause much larger exchange rate fluctuations. Anyone who puts money into Bitcoin should take measures to reduce their risk and consider it as a high-risk currency. Later, as Bitcoin becomes better known and more widely accepted, it should stabilize, but for the time being it is unpredictable. Any investment in Bitcoin should be done carefully and with a clear plan to manage risk.<p>

<h3><a name="can-bitcoins-become-worthless">Can bitcoins become worthless?</a></h3>
<p>Yes. There are thousands of currencies in the fiat currency graveyard as a result of hyperinflation, such as the German Mark, United States gold and silver certificates, Argentine Peso, and, more recently, the Zimbabwe Dollar. Unlike a physical currency, such as gold, Bitcoin is a completely virtual currency. While Bitcoin was designed to be censorship-resistant, to enable it to continue existing if there were to be some type of technological problem of significant severity, it is still possible, although more unlikely every day, that Bitcoin could stop working as intended. Then all bitcoins could become worthless.</p>
<p>Being an open-source project allows anyone to contribute software code and those with value stored in bitcoins have a strong financial incentive in making sure Bitcoin continues to exist. For example, there has been only one major security incident in the protocol and it was fixed in August 2010. While there have been no major incidents since that does not preclude the possibility that there could be others. There was an unanticipated \"hard fork\" on 12 March 2013 which was quickly resolved with minimal impact on Bitcoin users. But the longer Bitcoin exists without a major security incident, or other unanticipated software bugs, then the more likely market participants will gain greater confidence in Bitcoin.</p>

<h3><a name="is-bitcoin-virtual-and-immaterial">Is Bitcoin virtual and immaterial?</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin is as virtual as the credit cards and online banking networks that people are using every day. They are both a balance stored in a network.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin is better suited for use on the Internet than other payment systems, Bitcoin can also be used to pay in physical stores, just like real money.</p>
<p>Bitcoin users have exclusive control over their funds. Bitcoin balances are stored in an extremely large, decentralized distributed computer network and they cannot be fraudulently altered by anybody. In other terms, bitcoins cannot vanish or be seized by any means. But they can be stolen or lost due to users' mistakes.</p>

<h3><a name="is-bitcoin-anonymous">Is Bitcoin anonymous?</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin is a censorship-resistant technology. It is not anonymous but it is pseudo-anonymous. The use of Bitcoin leaves extensive and permanent public records for each transaction. All transactions can be traced since their origin and IP addresses are permanently logged by organizations listening on the network. All of this information can easily be accessed by competitors, law enforcement, or anyone else.</p>
<p>However, there are a few technically difficult and costly methods that can enable users to interact with Bitcoin in very private ways. The Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded on page two of the report <em>Bitcoin Virtual Currency: Unique Features Present Distinct Challenges for Deterring Illicit Activity</em> that ‘The FBI assesses with low confidence, based on current user and vendor acceptance, that malicious actors will exploit Bitcoin to launder money.’</p>
<p>Transactions are difficult to conceal from best practices in network data analysis, data mining, and forensic accounting techniques. In most transactions, personal information must be revealed to receive the goods or services from an order. This makes keeping full anonymity with Bitcoin transactions very difficult or impossible.</p>

<h3><a name="what-happens-when-bitcoins-are-lost">What happens when bitcoins are lost?</a></h3>
<p>Because of the law of supply and demand, when fewer bitcoins are available the ones that are left will be in higher demand, and therefore will have a higher value. So, as Bitcoins are lost, the remaining bitcoins will eventually increase in value to compensate. As the value of a bitcoin increases, the number of bitcoins required to purchase an item '''de'''creases. This is a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deflationary_spiral">deflationary economic model</a>. As the average transaction size reduces, transactions will probably be denominated in sub-units of a bitcoin such as millibitcoins ("Millies") or microbitcoins ("Mikes").</p>
<p>The Bitcoin protocol uses a base unit of one hundred-millionth of a Bitcoin ("a Satoshi"), but unused bits are available in the protocol fields that could be used to denote even smaller subdivisions.</p>

<h3><a name="can-bitcoin-scale-to-become-a-major-payment-network">Can Bitcoin scale to become a major payment network?</a></h3>
<p>The Bitcoin protocol allows lightweight clients that can use Bitcoin without downloading the entire transaction history. As traffic grows and this becomes more critical, implementations of the concept will be developed. Full network nodes will at some point become a more specialized service.</p>
<p>With some modifications to the software, full Bitcoin nodes could easily keep up with both VISA and MasterCard combined, using only fairly modest hardware (a single high end server by todays standards). It is worth noting that the MasterCard network is structured somewhat like Bitcoin itself - as a peer to peer broadcast network.</p>

<h2><a name="#legal">Legal</a></h2>

<h3><a name="is-bitcoin-legal">Is Bitcoin legal?</a></h3>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, Bitcoin has not been made illegal by legislation in any jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Additionally, regulators from various jurisdictions have taken steps to provide individuals and businesses with rules on how to integrate this new technology into businesses and other activities. For example, the United States' FinCEN has issued non-binding and non-determinative guidance on how it characterizes certain activities involving virtual currencies.</p>

<h3><a name="is-bitcoin-useful-for-illegal-activities">Is Bitcoin useful for illegal activities?</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin is a censorship-resistant technology. This means transactions cannot be stopped. However, it is not anonymous, and the use of Bitcoin leaves extensive and permanent public records.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded on page two of the report <em>Bitcoin Virtual Currency: Unique Features Present Distinct Challenges for Deterring Illicit Activity</em> that ‘The FBI assesses with low confidence, based on current user and vendor acceptance, that malicious actors will exploit Bitcoin to launder money.’</p>
<p>Bitcoin prevents many criminals from being able to engage in illegal behavior. Because of the way Bitcoin works, customers do not need to reveal personal information to merchants. This decreases the amount of data available to illegal actors and acts as significant protection against identity theft, credit card fraud, and several other attack vectors. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible which prevents chargebacks or frauds, and transaction traceability means it is impossible to counterfeit bitcoins.</p>
<p>Additionally, law enforcement authorities have already begun using sophisticated techniques to analyze Bitcoin transactions in their criminal investigations. So it may be that the Bitcoin software is not very attractive for criminal enterprises.</p>

<h3><a name="what-about-bitcoin-and-taxes">What about Bitcoin and taxes?</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin is not a fiat currency with legal tender status in any jurisdiction, but often tax liability accrues regardless of the medium used. There is a wide variety of legislation in many different jurisdictions which could cause income, sales, payroll, capital gains, or some other form of tax liability to arise with Bitcoin. Because all transactions are public record and stored permanently, it is a bad idea to attempt to use Bitcoin to evade taxes.</p>

<h3><a name="how-the-bitcoins-are-being-created">How the bitcoins are being created?</a></h3>
<p>New bitcoins are generated by the network through the process of <i>mining</i>. In a process that is similar to a continuous raffle draw, mining nodes on the network are awarded bitcoins each time they find the solution to a certain mathematical problem (and thereby create a new <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block">block</a>). Creating a block is a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work">proof of work</a> with a difficulty that varies with the overall strength of the network. The reward for solving a block is <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_Currency_Supply">automatically adjusted</a> so that in roughly the first four years of operation of the Bitcoin network, {{formatnum:10500000}} BTC will be created. This amount is halved each four years, so it will be {{formatnum:5250000}} over years 4-8, {{formatnum:2625000}} over years 8-12, and so on. Thus the total number of bitcoins in existence will not exceed {{formatnum:21000000}}. See <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_Currency_Supply">Controlled Currency Supply</a>.</p>
<p>Blocks are <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining">mined</a> every 10 minutes, on average and for the first four years ({{formatnum:210000}} blocks) each block includes 50 new bitcoins. As the amount of processing power directed at mining changes, the difficulty of creating new bitcoins changes. This difficulty factor is calculated every 2016 blocks and is based upon the time taken to generate the previous 2016 blocks. See <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining">Mining</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blockexplorer.com/q/totalbc">Current number of bitcoins in existence</a>. Also see <a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/total-bitcoins">Total bitcoins in circulation chart</a></p>
<p>The number of blocks times the coin value of a block is the number of coins in existence. The coin value of a block is 50 BTC for each of the first {{formatnum:210000}} blocks, 25 BTC for the next {{formatnum:210000}} blocks, then 12.5 BTC, 6.25 BTC and so on.</p>
<p>The last block that will generate coins will be block #6,929,999 which should be generated at or near the year 2140. The total number of coins in circulation will then remain static at 20,999,999.9769 BTC.</p>
<p>Even if the allowed precision is expanded from the current 8 decimals, the total BTC in circulation will always be slightly below 21 million (assuming everything else stays the same). For example, with 16 decimals of precision, the end total would be 20,999,999.999999999496 BTC.</p>

<h3><a name="is-bitcoin-secure">Is Bitcoin secure?</a></h3>
<p>The Bitcoin technology - the protocol and the cryptography - has a strong security track record. Bitcoin's vulnerability is in user error. Bitcoin wallet files that store the necessary private keys can be accidentally deleted, lost, stolen, or compromised. Consequently, users need to employ <a href=\"/en/secure-your-wallet\">security practices</a> to protect their money or use service providers that offer good levels of security and insurance. As more people have adopted Bitcoin, more service providers have appeared to make it easier, safer, and more convenient to use and safely secure bitcoins. Bitcoins are not covered by insurance schemes or depositor insurance like the FDIC, but users' wallets could be with a service provider that offers that provision.</p>

<h3><a name="why-does-bitcoins-have-value">Why does bitcoins have value?</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoins have value because they are useful and because they are <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_Currency_Supply">scarce</a>. Technically speaking, Bitcoin can have all the attributes of money (fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability) based on the properties of mathematics instead of relying on the physical properties of a rock like gold or of a politically issued currency. With these attributes, all that is required for a form of money to gain value is trust and acceptance. In the case of Bitcoin, this can be measured by its growing base of users, merchants and startups.</p>

<h3><a name="what-determines-bitcoins-price">What determines Bitcoin’s price?</a></h3>
<p>The price of bitcoins is determined by supply and demand. The supply is fixed at 21 million because of the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. There are two main types of demand: speculative and transactional. As more people use bitcoins for transactions, demand will increase and so will the price of bitcoins. Likewise, as more people speculate on the future of Bitcoin by saving or hoarding bitcoins, this increases the demand for bitcoins and the price. The result is an increase of network effects and increased adoption.</p>

<h3><a name="is-bitcoin-a-bubble">Is Bitcoin a bubble?</a></h3>
<p>A fast rise in price does not constitute a bubble. An artificial over-valuation that will suddenly downward correct constitutes a bubble.</p>
<p>Choices based on individual human action by hundreds of thousands of market participants is the cause for Bitcoin's price to fluctuate as the market seeks price discovery. Some reasons for this change in sentiment may be a loss of confidence in the currency, a large difference between value and price not based on the fundamentals of the Bitcoin economy, excessive press coverage stimulating speculative demand, fear of uncertainty, and just old-fashioned irrational exuberance and greed.</p>

<h3><a name="is-bitcoin-a-ponzi-scheme">Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?</a></h3>
<p>A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from their own money, or the money paid by subsequent investors, instead of from profit earned by the individual or organization running the operation.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is an open-source software project with no central authority and consequently no one is in a position to make fraudulent representations about investment returns. Like other major currencies such as gold, United States dollars, Euros, Yen, etc. there is no guaranteed purchasing power and the exchange rate freely floats. This can lead to volatility where owners of bitcoins can make or lose value.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is an innovative payment system and not a Ponzi scheme. However, since Bitcoin transactions are irreversible it can be attractive for a Ponzi scam operator, and there have been several notable Ponzi scams which have failed and did use Bitcoin.</p>

<h3><a name="doesnt-bitcoin-unfairly-benefit-early-adopters">Doesn't Bitcoin unfairly benefit early adopters?</a></h3>
<p>Some early adopters have a large number of bitcoins now because they took a risk and invested resources in an unproven technology. However, many of them also spent a great part of their bitcoins quite a few times and didn't make huge gains. The Bitcoin market is a free market and there is no garantee that the price will increase or drop. It is very similar to investing in a early startup that is either gaining value through its usefulness and popularity over time, or just never break through.</p>

<h3><a name="wont-the-finite-amount-of-bitcoins-create-excessive-deflation">Won't the finite amount of Bitcoins create excessive deflation?</a></h3>
<p>Unlike most currencies, Bitcoin will likely experience gradual increase of its price with the passage of time. Bitcoin is unique in that only 21 millions bitcoins will ever be created. This number has been known since the project's inception, and the units are created at a predicable rate.</p>
<p>Bitcoins can already be divided up to 8 decimal places ( 0.000 000 01 BTC ) and it will probably take decades before this doesn't suffice to cover the needs of the economy, if this even happens. This leaves plenty of time for developers find a way to increase Bitcoin divisibility. Following important price increases over time, Bitcoin users don't need to display their prices with more than two decimal places. Prices can also be displayed in mBTC (0.001 BTC) or satoshis (0.000 000 01 BTC) .</p>
<p>When a user loses his wallet, its has the same effect of removing money out of circulation. This is pretty similar to a perfect redistribution of wealth to all other Bitcoin users through global deflation. These lost bitcoins could, however, be recovered by some new mining operations in a distant future if Bitcoin needed to move to different algorithms following the advancement of quantum computing technologies.</p>
<p>FIXME a note about the deflationary spiral argument here?</p>

<h3><a name="what-if-someone-bought-up-all-the-existing-bitcoins">What if someone bought up all the existing Bitcoins?</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin markets are competitive -- meaning the price of a bitcoin will rise or fall depending on supply and demand at certain price levels. Only a fraction of bitcoins issued to date are found on the exchange markets for sale. So even though technically a buyer with lots of money could buy all the bitcoins offered for sale, unless those holding the rest of the bitcoins offer them for sale as well, even the wealthiest, most determined buyer can't get at them.</p>
<p>Additionally, new currency continues to be issued daily and will continue to do so for decades though over time the rate at which they are issued declines to insignificant levels. Those who are mining aren't obligated to sell their bitcoins so not all bitcoins will make it to the markets even.</p>
<p>This situation doesn't suggest, however, that the markets aren't vulnerable to price manipulation. It doesn't take significant amounts of money to move the market price up or down and thus Bitcoin remains a volatile asset.</p>

<h3><a name="what-if-someone-creates-a-better-digital-currency">What if someone creates a better digital currency?</a></h3>
<p>That can certainly happens. As for now, Bitcoin remains by far the first and foremost private decentralized virtual currency but there can't be any guarantees that it will retain that position. There is already a set of alternative currencies floating around Bitcoin. It is however generally safe to assume that significant improvements would be required for a new digital currency to outrace Bitcoin in terms of esthablished market and networking effect, even though this cannot be predicted by anybody.</p>

<h2><a name="transaction">Transaction</a></h2>

<h3><a name="why-do-i-have-to-wait-10-minutes">Why do I have to wait 10 minutes?</a></h3>

FIXME 10 minutes for a receiving transaction, risk of frauds for instant transactions. 10 minutes before you can spend a received transaction.

<p>10 minutes is the average time taken to find a block. It can be significantly more or less time than that depending on luck; 10 minutes is simply the average case. </p>
<p>You can see how long all other recent transactions have taken here: <a href="http://bitcoinstats.org/">BitcoinStats.org</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Blocks">Blocks</a> (shown as "confirmations" in the GUI) are how the Bitcoin achieves consensus on who owns what. Once a block is found everyone agrees that you now own those coins, so you can spend them again. Until then it's possible that some network nodes believe otherwise, if somebody is attempting to defraud the system by reversing a transaction. The more confirmations a transaction has, the less risk there is of a reversal. Only 6 blocks or 1 hour is enough to make reversal computationally impractical. This is dramatically better than credit cards which can see chargebacks occur up to three months after the original transaction!</p>
<p>Ten minutes was specifically chosen by <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi">Satoshi</a> as a tradeoff between propagation time of new blocks in large networks and the amount of work wasted due to chain splits. For a more technical explanation, see Satoshi's <a href="/bitcoin.pdf">original technical paper</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="i-was-sent-some-bitcoins-and-they-havent-arrived-where-are-they">I was sent some bitcoins and they haven't arrived, where are they?</a></h3>
<p>Don't panic! There are a number of reasons why your bitcoins might not show up yet, and a number of ways to diagnose them. </p>
<p>The latest version of the Bitcoin-Qt client tells you how far it has yet to go in downloading the block chain. Hover over the icon in the bottom right corner of the client to learn your client's status.</p>
<p>If it has not caught up then it's possible that your transaction hasn't been included in a block yet. </p>
<p>You can check pending transactions in the network by going <a href="http://blockchain.info">here</a> and then searching for your address. If the transaction is listed here then it's a matter of waiting until it gets included in a block before it will show in your client. </p>
<p>If the transaction is based on a coin that was in a recent transaction then it could be considered a low priority transaction. Transfers can take longer if the transaction fee paid was not high enough. If there is no fee at all the transfer can get a very low priority and take hours or even days to be included in a block.</p>

<h3><a name="how-much-will-the-transaction-fee-be">How much will the transaction fee be?</a></h3>
<p>Some transactions might require a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fee">transaction fee</a> for them to get confirmed in a timely manner. The transaction fee is processed by and received by the bitcoin miner. The most recent version of the Bitcoin client will estimate an appropriate fee when a fee might be required.</p>
<p>The fee is added to the payment amount. For example, if you are sending a 1.234 BTC payment and the client requires a 0.0005 BTC fee, then 1.2345 BTC will be subtracted from the wallet balance for the entire transaction and the address for where the payment was sent will receive a payment of 1.234 BTC.</p>
<p>A fee might be imposed because your transaction looks like a denial of service attack to the Bitcoin system. For example, it might be burdensome to transmit or it might recycle Bitcoins you recently received. The wallet software attempts to avoid generating burdensome transactions, but it isn't always able to do so: The funds in your wallet might be new or composed of many tiny payments.</p>
<p>Because the fee is related to the amount of data that makes up the transaction and not to the amount of Bitcoins being sent, the fee may seem extremely low (0.0005 BTC for a 1,000 BTC transfer) or unfairly high (0.004 BTC for a 0.02 BTC payment, or about 20%). If you are receiving tiny amounts (''e.g.'' as small payments from a mining pool) then fees when sending will be higher than if your activity follows the pattern of conventional consumer or business transactions. </p>
<p>As of Bitcoin 0.5.3 the required fee will not be higher than 0.05 BTC. For most users there is usually no required fee at all. If a fee is required it will most commonly be 0.0005 BTC.</p>

<h3><a name="what-if-someone-sends-me-a-bitcoin-when-my-computer-is-powered-off">What if someone sends me a bitcoin when my computer is powered off?</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoins are not actually "sent" to your wallet; the software only uses that term so that we can use the currency without having to learn new concepts. Your wallet is only needed when you wish to spend coins that you've received.</p>
<p>If you are sent coins when your wallet client program is not running, and you later launch the wallet client program, the coins will eventually appear as if they were just received in the wallet. That is to say, when the client program is started it must download blocks and catch up with any transactions it did not already know about.</p>

<h3><a name="what-does-synchronizing-means-and-why-is-it-so-long">What does "synchronizing" means and why is it taking so long?</a></h3>
<p>The popular Bitcoin client software from bitcoin.org implements a "full" Bitcoin node: It can carry out all the duties of the Bitcoin P2P system, it isn't simply a "client". One of the principles behind the operation of full Bitcoin nodes is that they don't assume that the other participants have followed the rules of the Bitcoin system. During synchronization, the software is processing historical Bitcoin transactions and making sure for itself that all of the rules of the system have been correctly followed.</p>
<p>In normal operation, after synchronizing, the software should use a hardly noticeable amount of your computer's resources.</p>
<p>When the wallet client program is first installed, its initial validation requires a lot of work from your computer's hard disk, so the amount of time to synchronize depends on your disk speed and, to a lesser extent, your CPU speed. It can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or so. On a slow computer it could take more than 40 hours of continuous synchronization, so check your computer's power-saving settings to ensure that it does not turn its hard disk off when unattended for a few hours. You can use the Bitcoin software during synchronization, but you may not see recent payments to you until the client program has caught up to the point where those transactions happened.</p>
<p>If you feel that this process takes too long, you can download a pre-synchronized block chain from <a href="http://eu2.bitcoincharts.com/blockchain/">http://eu2.bitcoincharts.com/block chain/</a>. Alternatively, you can try an alternative "lite" client such as Multibit or a super-light client like electrum, though these clients have somewhat weaker security, are less mature, and don't contribute to the health of the P2P network.</p>

<h2><a name="mining">Mining</a></h2>

<h3><a name="what-is-mining">What is mining?</a></h3>
<p>Mining is the process of spending computation power to process Bitcoin transactions, secure them against reversal and introducing new bitcoins to the system at a predictable rate.</p>
<p>All Bitcoin miners are required to provide proof of works, which are mathematic proofs that fit very rare attributes. A proof of work can be extremely hard to generate but their validity can always be verified in less than a second by the network. Because there is no way to generate a proof of work other than trying millions of random calculations, miners cannot cheat and are forced to do these calculations before their blocks are accepted by the network. One of the attributes of these proof of work depends on the previous blocks, which makes it exponentially difficult to change a previous block because this would require to recalculate all proof of works of all following blocks. Over time as more miners join the network, the difficulty of these calculations is automatically increased by the network.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, mining is the calculation of a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hash">hash</a> of the a block header, which includes among other things a reference to the previous block, a hash of a set of transactions and a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Nonce">nonce</a>. If the hash value is found to be less than the current <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Target">target</a> (which is inversely proportional to the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty">difficulty</a>), a new block is formed and the miner gets the newly generated Bitcoins (25 per block at current levels). If the hash is not less than the current target, a new nonce is tried, and a new hash is calculated. This is done millions of times per second by each miner.</p>

<h3><a name="how-does-mining-work">How does Bitcoin mining work?</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin miners perform a function that is analogous to gold mining, but very different. While gold miners deal with rocks, Bitcoin miners deal with data.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining is the mechanism that keeps everyone in the system synchronized together. To mine, computers that take part listen for transactions (ledger transfer announcements) broadcast through the peer-to-peer network. The miners process and confirm these transactions by including them in a block and adding the block to the block chain.</p>
<p>Bitcoin miners perform this labor because miners that solve a block earn (1) any transaction fees paid by customers for faster transaction processing and (2) newly created coins, issued into existence according to a fixed formula.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining is a very competitive market. Bitcoin miners are neither able to increase their own block reward beyond the rules in the protocol nor process fraudulent transactions that could corrupt the Bitcoin network. Because anyone can become a Bitcoin miner and the Bitcoin network is the largest distributed computer network in the world, it is extremely improbable that a malicious Bitcoin miner could compromise the block chain. Thus, Bitcoin mining is used to protect the neutrality and the consensus of the network, even if not all Bitcoin miners can be trusted.</p>

<h3><a name="is-it-not-a-waste-of-energy">Is it not a waste of energy?</a></h3>
<p>Spending energy on creating and securing a free monetary system is hardly a waste. Also, services necessary for the operation of currently widespread monetary systems, such as banks and credit card companies, also spend a lot of energy. This energy consumption is just not transparent and cannot be evaluated publicly like Bitcoin.</p>

<h3><a name="how-does-mining-help-secure-bitcoin">How does mining help secure Bitcoin?</a></h3>
<p>Mining basically creates the equivalence of a competitive lottery that makes it very difficult for anyone to consecutively add new blocks in the block chain. Therefore protecting the neutrality of the network by preventing any individual to gain the power to block certain transactions or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends, which could be used to defraud other users.</p>

<h3><a name="what-do-i-need-to-start-mining">What do I need to start mining?</a></h3>
<p>In the early days of Bitcoin, it was easy for anyone to find new blocks using standard CPUs. As more and more people started mining, the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty">difficulty</a> of finding new blocks has greatly increased to the point where the only cost-effective method of mining is using specialized hardware (ASICs). See <a href="http://www.bitcoinmining.com/">BitcoinMining.com</a> for more informations.</p>

<h2><a name="security">Security</a></h2>

<h3><a name="could-miners-collude-and-break-bitcoin">Could miners collude and break Bitcoin?</a></h3>
<p>It isn't possible to change the Bitcoin protocol with a majority of miners. Any miner that doesn't comply with the current protocol immediately generates a parallel chain fork as the rest of the network is rejecting blocks from these miners, including all Bitcoin clients that are not mining. As per the current specification, no double spending is possible on the same block chain, therefore miners cannot generate uncontrolled amounts of bitcoins out of thin air or anything similar.</p>
<p>However, a majority of miners could arbirarily choose to block or reverse targeted recent transactions, even though they could by no means spend other users bitcoins. This could be used for censorship purposes or to defraud merchants, by reversing a payment after receiving goods and services. But this can also be used for legitimate purposes, like applying a collaborative emergency action to help fixing a problem with the network like the <a href="/en/alert/2013-03-11-chain-fork">march 2013 chain fork</a></p>

<h3><a name="hasnt-bitcoin-been-hacked-in-the-past">Hasn't Bitcoin been hacked in the past?</a></h3>
<p>In the very early days, Bitcoin first implementations were not stable and without surprise, they suffered from.. but these attacks were reversed in a due time before Bitcoin started to be known from the general public. FIXME The protocol itself however has a strong security track record and has never suffered from a security breach.</p>
<p>However when people think that Bitcoin has been hacked, they are more likely to refer to various theft and security breaches that happened on various exchanges or businesses. These events do not represent that Bitcoin is compromised by any means. For instance, a bank being robbed doesn't mean the dollar is compromised. The same logic apply here.</p>
<p>However it is true that as a new technology, a complete set of good practices and security measures need to be developers around Bitcoin to help users having a better control and protection of their money. This is a part of the risks of the early adopters.. This process in ongoing with...</p>

<p>In the history of Bitcoin, there has never been an attack on the block chain that resulted in permanent stolen money from a confirmed output. Neither has there ever been a reported theft resulting directly from a vulnerability in the original Bitcoin client, or a vulnerability in the protocol. Bitcoin is secured by standard cryptographic functions. These functions have been peer reviewed by cryptography experts and are considered unlikely to be breakable in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that the currency itself has never been 'hacked'. However, several major websites using the currency have been hacked, often resulting in high profile Bitcoin heists. These heists are misreported in some media as hacks on Bitcoin itself. An analogy: Just because someone stole US dollars from a supermarket till, doesn’t mean that the US dollar as a currency has been 'hacked'.</p>
<p>Most bitcoin thefts are the result of inadequate wallet security. In response to the wave of thefts in 2011 and 2012, the community has developed risk-mitigating measures such as wallet encryption, support for multiple signatures, offline wallets, paper wallets, and hardware wallets. As these measures gain adoption by merchants and users, it is expected that the number of thefts will drop.</p>
